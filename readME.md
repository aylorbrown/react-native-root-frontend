## ROOT 

### Project description 
ROOT is a pelvic floor exercise app for people with vaginas. Tired of women's health apps that define pelvic floor health in terms of a woman using her body in service of others - heterosexual sex or childbirth -  I created ROOT to the importance of a strong pelvic floor in terms of a woman's mental and physical health and quality of life. 

In eastern traditions, the pelvic floor is associated with the root chakra.

ROOT begins with three basic pelvic floor exercises: kegels, deep squats, and belly breathing. Each exercises utilizes a countdown timer, which keeps track of user data with a ```saveData``` function. 

When the user finishes an exercise, they are redirected to the home page which contains a progress chart component. Each exercise has a different colored bar.
